        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>I've bee listening to music daily for years now. The most notable artist in my life has to be lil peep.</p>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xLnhtTlwjak/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwE7CK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAy0IARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGH8gHygTMA8=&rs=AOn4CLA1tcHGu9g4Yn5NDfQo6Qkwcg5X1A">
        <p>Peep was the reason I started getting tattoos myself, 2 of my tattoos are actually references to him.
            I first heard about peep at around 2018 when "spotlight" music video was released while playing roblox
            and listening to those cringe "best 2018 gaming remixes", I remember this vividly. I saw the music video
            pop up in my recommendations and only clicked it cause I saw "marshmello" in the name, he was the shit back then
            and they collabbed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Aside from peep, the artists I listen to the most right now would be Wett brain, Suicideboys, a bit of kendrick sometimes, killstation, kxllswxtch, suisside,
            iann dior, teenage disaster, zillakami, ivoxygen, juice wrld, lil darkie and some smaller artists here and there.
