        <p>I don't play many games anymore as nothing really interests me, I'm currently playing Valorant and a new release called Rune slayer (on roblox).
            If I had to tell you my favorite games of all time, they would have to be Hades and Rogue Lineage. My favorite genres have to be permadeath games
            like rogue lineage, though roguelites like Hades really stick to me as well. Hollow knight was pretty good as well, though silksong is never getting released.
            if you're interested, here's my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/razborcikas/">steam page</a>, though I don't really play steam games anymore.
            I also love fishing mechanics in games, especially if you can get random loot through it, like chests, rare items, etc.. I love rare loot mechanics in games overall.
