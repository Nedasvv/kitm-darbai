    <h1>my amazing pet</h1>
    <p>His name is Murkis, he's probably like 11 years old now I think, no clue tbh. We've got a love-hate relationship going on.
        He scratches and bites me if he doesn't get what he wants immediately. He loves to lay on me, that's the only time you can really
        pet him. Other times, he'll take pets as a declaration of war. He also loves to lay on my backpack, my chair, looking out the window,
        he really loves going outside and spending the entire day there, but our new neighbors keep giving us shit for not taking care of our cat
        so we can't really let him outside anymore. He can open multiple types of doors by himself btw, he's smarter than me. You can find tons of his pictures
        on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18007625384207664/">instagram highlight called "car"</a> :) here's one pic tho.
