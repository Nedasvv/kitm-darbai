    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Born on 2005-06-06 in Lithuania, 19 years old as of writing this. Well-versed in both Lithuanian and English languages.
     I've been watching anime ever since I was 5-6 years old, started reading manhwa, manhua and manga later on.
     I've watched approx 4-5k anime episodes at least as of now. Avid listener of music as well, more on that on the <a href="">music</a> page.
