    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Born on 2005-06-06 in Lithuania, 19 years old as of writing this. Well-versed in both Lithuanian and English languages.
     I've been watching anime ever since I was 5-6 years old, started reading manhwa, manhua and manga later on.
     I've watched approx 4-5k anime episodes at least as of now. Avid listener of music as well, more on that on the <a href="music.html">music</a> page.
     Learned programming as a hobby in the past, currently in school for it. Used to do tons of sports like judo, swimming, etc.. though after a trauma
     at the gym, I've been on a hiatus for a couple years now. I love tattoos, I've got 5 tattoos myself and if money wasn't an issue, I'd already have my entire <body>
     tatted.

    <p>
        I enjoy listening to music, watching anime, reading manhwa, manga and manhua alike. I love playing video games and hanging out with my friends like any other person.
        Never had much of a social life though. I keep my friend circle pretty small and trusted, especially after 2024 when I was betrayed pretty badly by some of my closest friends.
