    <center><h1>More about alucard</h1></center>
    <p>Alucard《アーカード, Ākādo, OVA: Arucard[c]》 is one of the three main protagonists of the Hellsing series created by Kohta Hirano, alongside Sir Integra and Seras Victoria. In both adaptations of Hellsing, he is voiced by Jouji Nakata in the Japanese sub and Crispin Freeman in the English dub.

        He is the Trump Card and pride of the Hellsing Agency which works against vampires and other such supernatural forces. He answers to only the Hellsing family and no one else, usually asking to the point of demanding for orders from his master by saying, "Give me your orders, my Master《命令をよこせ我が主》" more than once until he receives a definitive answer. It has been implied that he is the most powerful vampire alive as a result of a century worth of experiments done to him by the Hellsing family to create what is essentially the "Ultimate Undead." </p>

        <center><h2>Some Abilities</h2></center>
            <p>Hematophagy: As a vampire, Alucard can consume blood raw.[195] He has long, conical fangs to assist in this job as well as a serpentine-like tongue.[196] His feeding habits have been seen to vary: from traditional neck-biting[197] to simply ripping people to pieces[198] and outright devouring them.[199]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aestivation: Alucard will enter a dormant state if he goes too long without blood. It is unknown if he can be starved to death, as he goes decades without a drop of blood before a young Integra finds him.[200][201] </p>
            <br>
            <p> 	Hemokinesis: Alucard has the ability to manipulate blood.[202][203] This ability seems to be limited to blood outside of the body, as he is never seen influencing the blood of enemies while they are intact. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Enhanced Regeneration: Alucard has the ability to perfectly and quickly recover from any physical injury, perhaps as a result of decades worth of research done by the Hellsing family.[92][36] He has been torn to shreds by conventional weaponry and has survived all of it.[39][40][41] Holy weapons, while they do affect him more,[204] are regenerated all the same. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Third Eye: Alucard has senses that are not only sharper than a mortal's, affording him abilities such as perfect accuracy, but he has abilities that they completely lack. In particular, he possesses a "third eye" that allows him to see things from far, far distances.[205] Though he never uses it to do so, he can likely see through things that fool human eyes, as Seras does when facing Zorin Blitz.[206] This is not an inherent ability and must be used consciously, as Alucard was unable to see through Tubalcain's illusionary clones.[207] Using his third eye, Alucard can also detect supernatural activity; in Warsaw 1944, Alucard knew The Captain was a werewolf the moment he saw him.[208] Later during the incident in Badrick, he could see the blessings on Father Anderson's bayonets as well as the holy barrier preventing their escape.[209][94]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dark Composition: Though he generally dons a corporeal, humanoid form, Alucard is made up of a highly variable otherworldly substance.[210][k] This can be especially seen whenever he takes heavy damage, the darkness being immune to conventional weaponry.[189] Along with composing his being, it can serve as a weapon.[212]</p>
